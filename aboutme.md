### My story

As of 2025, I am a 20yr old aspiring Software Engineer while also focusing on creating an IT company that specialized on many fields of the industry. Currently I am focused on building a passion project game that I have been wanting to complete for a few years now. I like to post updates about my work in their respective subpages :) for those who are interested.
